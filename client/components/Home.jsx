        <p>Kia ora, I'm Aaron. Currently making the leap into a new career in full stack web development. When I'm not working I'm outside, doing resistance training in the gym, collecting/restoring worn dress shoes and boots or hanging out with friends. I also like to game, used to play Quake Live competitively.</p>
